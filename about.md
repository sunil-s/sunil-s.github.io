- ***Staff data scientist*** with over 6 years of industry-related experience. I am interested in opportunities relating to applied artificial intelligence research and product development.
- Current role involves developing machine learning algorithms in the area of ***deep and reinforcement learning*** that are applicable to real-world problems.
- Strong machine learning fundamentals and a sound mathematical understanding of deep/reinforcement learning areas, including ***CNNs, RNNs/LSTMs, GANs, VAEs, NLP, multi-arm bandits, Thompson sampling, deep Q-learning, policy gradient algorithms and actor-critic methods***.
- Experienced in working on a wide range of machine learning problems such as object detection and classification, semantic segmentation, transfer learning, collaborative and content-based filtering approaches for recommender systems, sentiment analysis using word2vec models, semi-supervised video classification, time series data analysis using sequence models, and continual decision making for control systems using deep reinforcement learning.
- ***Proven track record of publications and patents***: authored 5 journal manuscripts, 12 conference papers and 11 invention disclosures. My publications have garnered over 500 citations.
- ***Ph.D.*** in electrical engineering with a strong emphasis on probabilistic analysis, optimization and stochastic modeling. My thesis work focused on the design and analysis of optimal scheduling and routing algorithms for multi-hop wireless networks.
- Over 3.5 years of experience in the semiconductor industry involving algorithm design and performance evaluation for SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer) transceivers that are used in high-speed digital communications for storage and networking applications.
- Solid knowledge of probability and random processes, statistics, optimization, detection and estimation theory, signal processing, digital communications and information theory.
- Proficient in data structures, algorithms and coding in ***Python***.
